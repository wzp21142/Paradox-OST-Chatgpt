Translate non-standard paradox-style yml i18n files with AI Assistance. With just one step, then you can enjoy mods and games with all text localized!

**Personal Proposal: If you intend to publicly release the translation mod generated by this tool, please respect the work of the manual translators and proofreaders, and indicate that the mod was translated by ChatGPT!**
## Usage

**Step 1**. Create .env file with openai key
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your key>
```
**Step 2**. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Step 3**. Run the script
```bash
python translate.py -i "YOUR_SOURCE_DIRECTORY" -l LANGUAGE -o "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"
```
The script will find YML files in all subfolders of source directory, so the SOURCE_DIRECTORY should be like"...\localization\english" or other languages. DO NOT ASSIGN THE "...\localization" FOLDER!
Notice that the output directory is unnecessary. If not provided, the default directory will be YOUR_SOURCE_DIRECTORY/localization/LANGUAGE.
For example, I run the script with 
```bash
python translate.py -i "...\localization\english" -l simp_chinese
```
then we can translate the english i18n files into translated files in "...\localization\simp_chinese".

**Step 4**. If you haven't specified an output path and are certain that there are no machine-translated i18n files in the default output path created by the mod developer, then you can enjoy it!

## Notice

1. The current version does not support excessively long YML files (subjected to OpenAI's limit of 4096 tokens), so if you need to translate your text, please split the file into multiple YML files or patiently wait for my future updates. BTW, PRs are very welcome and much appreciated. Sorry for the inconvenience!
2. The current script is only a preliminary version, and there may still be various bugs. Please feel free to create an issue!
